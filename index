<h3>
Introduction</h3>
<p>
If You don't eat eggs, the world will end. 
</p>
<ul>
Eggs are a moderate energy, nutrient-dense food providing 66 kcal, 6.4 g of protein and a wide range of micronutrients per medium egg, as shown in Table 1 [11]. A medium sized egg contains 4.6 g of total fat, with 1.7 g of this being monounsaturated fat. Alongside crustaceans and offal, eggs are rich in dietary cholesterol, providing 177 mg per medium egg. Cholesterol was viewed in the past as a negative nutrient, although risk assessment has evolved in line with newer evidence suggesting a lesser impact of dietary cholesterol on CVD risk versus saturated fat [12]. Egg yolk is one of the few naturally occurring food sources of vitamin D and the lipid matrix is believed to enhance bioavailability of yolk phytonutrients, such as lutein and zeaxanthin, 
although levels in the eggs depend on the hens’ diets and are lower in some countries, e.g., the UK
According to the European Commission Nutrition and Health Claims Regulation [15], various claims can be made in relation to the nutrient content of eggs (Table 2). Eggs are a ‘source of’ pantothenic acid, phosphorus, vitamin A and folate. In addition, eggs are ‘high in’ protein, monounsaturated fatty acids, vitamin D, vitamin B12, biotin, riboflavin, selenium and iodine. For each of these nutrients, the relevant health claims listed in Table 2 could be applied to eggs in commercial communications, including labelling [16]. Although there is currently no Dietary Reference Value for choline in the UK, a health claim for choline can be applied if a food provides at least 82.5 mg/100 g.
Eggs comfortably exceed this cut-off by providing 285 mg/100 g [17]. Potassium, calcium, iron, iodine, folate, vitamin D and fibre are highlighted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) as nutrients of concern for the European population [18]. Of these, choline, vitamin D, folate and iodine are provided by eggs in clinically useful quantities.
3.3. Choline
Choline is an essential micronutrient for infant growth and development and is typically found in eggs and beef liver, with lower amounts in plant-based foods such as almonds and broccoli [19]. Recommendations have been set by some expert bodies; for example, the Average Intake (AI) set by the EFSA are 400 mg/day for adolescents and adults; and 480 mg/day during pregnancy. The values set by US health bodies are 425 mg for female adults; 550 mg for male adults; and 450 mg during pregnancy [20,21]. An analysis of choline intake in nine European countries found that the average intake was well below that of the American AI [22].
Choline intakes are also low in pregnancy, with only 8.5% of women meeting the American AI according to a nationwide survey [23]. There is some evidence that increasing choline intake during pregnancy above the AI may benefit infant cognitive development. Two studies found that daily choline supplementation (930 mg, roughly twice the AI) in the third trimester of pregnancy improved infant information processing speed at 4–13 months and improved sustained attention at 7 years compared with supplementing at the current AI of 480 mg/day [24,25]. Since eggs provide a rich source of choline, they can boost choline status in groups with higher requirements and typically low intakes. In an Australian study, eggs were the most significant contributor to choline intake in the diets of pregnant women [26]. The previously mentioned study by Wallace et al. found that egg consumers had significantly greater choline intakes compared with non-consumers (525 mg/day vs. 294 mg/day, p < 0.0001) [23]. The efficacy of whole eggs for raising plasma choline levels is confirmed by another RCT where participants given daily whole egg, but not a yolk-free egg substitute, had significantly higher plasma choline levels compared with baseline (p = 0.01) [27].
3.4. Vitamin D
Attaining an optimal vitamin D status can be challenging since few foods are natural sources and, in all countries above 37 degrees latitude, sun-induced vitamin D synthesis cannot occur during autumn and winter months. In the Northern Hemisphere and in certain populations—those with darker skin pigmentation, limited sun exposure and who cover their skin for religious or cultural reasons—dietary sources of vitamin D, including supplements, are critical [28]. An assessment of European dietary intakes suggests that mean vitamin D intake from food was just 2.7 μg in women and 3.3 μg in men, a stark contrast to the current UK recommendation of 10 μg per day [29,30] and the new Irish recommendation of 15 μg per day [31]. Since eggs are one of the few foods naturally high in vitamin D, they present an opportunity to help minimise the shortfall in vitamin D intake. A recent RCT in 51 Australian adults found that, after 12-weeks of either 2, 7 or 14 eggs/week during winter months, serum 25(OH)-vitamin D levels had significantly reduced only in the group consuming the lowest number of eggs [32]. This study suggests that consuming between 7–14 eggs/week may help to attenuate the typical seasonal drop in circulating 25(OH)-vitamin D.
3.5. Folate
Several populations are at risk of low folate intakes. Insufficient folate/folic acid in women of childbearing age means their offspring would be sub-optimally protected against neural tube defects. Data from the most recent National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) in the UK found that 89% of women of childbearing age had a red blood cell folate concentration below the threshold indicating increased risk for NTDs (748 nmol/L) [33]. A recent review of nutritional requirements for adults aged ≥ 65 years proposed that intakes of 400 μg were deemed more appropriate for this age group than the current UK recommendation of 200 μg [30,34]. This is due to the increased risk of deficiency in older people, which is associated with neurological damage and potentially increased risk of dementia [35]. A secondary analysis of the NDNS data found that ‘health conscious’ egg consumers (consuming > 3 eggs/week and low intake of red or processed meat) had significantly higher intakes of folate than those consuming high amounts of red and processed meats and no eggs [36]. In addition, a more recent analysis of the NDNS data by Gibson et al. found that female consumers of eggs had significantly higher intake of folate as well as protein and omega-3 fatty acids [37]. It is likely that health-conscious egg consumers also ate more fruit and vegetables which would have contributed to folate intakes.
3.6. Iodine
Average European intake of iodine in females is estimated to be 127 μg, which is lower than the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendation of 150 μg/day [29,38]. Iodine is an essential nutrient for normal foetal brain development and a low status may impact fertility and the risk of preeclampsia [39]. One prospective study suggested that long-term iodine intake from food sources may be more important for optimal behavioural outcomes in infants than iodine supplementation during pregnancy [40]. As eggs are high in iodine, they could provide a useful addition to the diet both prior to and during pregnancy to aid sufficient iodine intake.
3.7. Protein
Eggs are considered a source of high-quality protein since they contribute all nine essential amino acids. Objective measures of protein quality and digestibility give a high value for eggs (97%), which is similar to that applied to other high value animal protein sources such as milk and cheese (95%) and meat (94%) [41].
The previously mentioned review by Dorrington et al. suggests that older adults are likely to have higher protein requirements and advises age-specific recommendations [34]. High-quality protein consumed frequently across the day supports myoprotection in combination with appropriate exercise, which helps to prevent loss of skeletal muscle mass and function in older adults [42]. The current protein recommendation for adults, as proposed by EFSA, is 0.83 g/kg body weight daily, whereas the recommendation made in the aforementioned paper is for 1.2 g/kg body weight daily, equating to 84 g for a 70 kg person [43]. Two medium eggs provide 12.8 g of high-quality protein which would make an important contribution to protein recommendations.
4. Results: Risk Assessment
4.1. Cardiovascular Health and Cholesterol
Table 3 summarises the findings of SRMA of RCT (n = 4) which considered links between egg consumption and cardiovascular health. SRMA of RCT provide the highest quality of evidence for examining health outcomes. The number of eggs consumed in the intervention arms ranged from 5 to 42 eggs/week and the control foods varied greatly, often resulting in high heterogeneity.

<p>I've been careful about dependencies; Git and Github are helpful, but not required. You can download a <a href="https://github.com/AndrewGYork/publication_template/zipball/master"><code>.zip</code> of this repository</a>, edit <code>index.html</code> with a text editor, and view the results with a web browser. I avoid Javascript which loads via the web, so you can work offline. My figure generation code depends on the <a href="https://www.scipy.org/stackspec.html">Scipy stack</a>, but this is easy to swap out; all you have to do is generate static images, put them in the proper folder, and link to them from <code>index.html</code>. You can generate your static images using any tool you choose. If you happen to use code to generate your figures, though, great! You can put this code in the <code>figure_generation</code> directory, enabling version control and simple reproduction of your results by others.</p>

<p>Writing directly in HTML/CSS/Javascript isn't for everyone. It's fiddly, has a learning curve, and requires obsessive attention to detail. In my experience, writing a scientific publication already fits this description, so it's a small price to pay, and one I'm already paying.</p>

<h3>
Math typesetting</h3>

<p>I use MathJax for typesetting. I want to be able to work offline, but a local MathJax copy is huge, so I followed the recipe described by <a href="https://tiborsimon.io/articles/web/minimal-mathjax/">Tibor Simon</a> to make a minimal version. The recipe's pretty cool; you delete most of MathJax, try to load it, watch your browser console, and copy files back one at a time until your browser stops complaining. I only support LaTex input; if you want more, you can follow Tibor's recipe and replace the contents of <code>/javascript/Minimal-MathJax/</code>.</p>

<p>Examples of paragraph equations:</p>
<div>
    $$\begin{equation}\prod_{\substack{1\le i \le n\\ 1\le j \le m}}M_{i,j} \end{equation}$$
    $$\begin{equation}L' = {L}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\end{equation} $$
    $$\begin{align} B'&=-\nabla \times E,\\E'&=\nabla \times B - 4\pi j,\end{align} $$
    $$\begin{equation}x = a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{a_2 + \frac{1}{a_3 + a_4}}}\end{equation} $$
